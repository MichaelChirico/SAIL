STEPS

I) ASSIGN MASTER ORDER

II) FIND NONDUPLICATES

 	FIRST, sort on Penn ID
    use condition (on row `n`, with IDs in row B):
    	IF(B`n`=B`n-1`,0,IF(B`n+1`=B`n`,0,1))
    	**Make sure to add 0 for first entry**

III) REMOVE NONDUPLICATES

	Sort on nonduplicate #, cut & paste to separate sheet
	Delete duplicated indicator column

IV) SORT BY SECTION NUMBER

V) SORT BY SECTION BLOCK NUMBER -> PENN ID

	Need to keep paired recitations as a whole block, so set Block Number to:
	010 - 1
	011 - 2
	012 - 3
	110 - 4
	111 - 4
	120 - 5
	121 - 5
	130 - 6
	131 - 6

V) "RESHAPE WIDE"

	Copy-paste second observations (recitation) of each ID side-by-side with first observations (lecture)
	(keep ALL columns, especially sequence number)

VI) SORT & COLOR BY RECITATION SECTION NUMBER

VII) RANDOMLY ASSIGN RECITATION, THEN LECTURE

	A) ASSIGN RANDOM NUMBER IN RIGHTMOST COLUMN
	B) SORT **WITHIN SECTION NUMBER** ACCORDING TO RANDOM VARIATE
	C) ASSIGN RECITATIONS IN SEQUENCE ACCORDING TO PROPORTIONS
	D) ASSIGN LECTURE **TO A COLUMN CLOSE TO LEFT HAND SIDE**

VIII) RESHAPE LONG AGAIN

	Re-paste recitation copy to below lecture copy
	**TAKE CARE TO MAKE SURE COLUMNS LINE UP**

IX) PASTE IN UNPAIRED OBSERVATIONS

X) RESORT BY MASTER ORDER
