STEPS

I) ASSIGN MASTER ORDER

II) FIND NONDUPLICATES

 	FIRST, sort on Penn ID (COLUMN B)
    use condition (on row `n`):
    	IF(OR(B`n`=B`n-1`,B`n+1`=B`n`),0,1)
    	**Make sure to add 0 for first entry**
	Over-write formula with value

III) FIX DUPLICATES

	copy-paste all duplicate rows below main file
	replace holding section with correct corresponding lecture
	Flag duplicated lectures with X for later deletion
	be sure to over-write formula with value

IV) SORT BY SECTION NUMBER (COLUMN F)

V) SORT BY SECTION BLOCK NUMBER -> PENN ID

	Need to keep paired recitations as a whole block, so set Block Number to:
	010 - 1
	011 - 2
	012 - 3
	110 - 4
	111 - 4
	120 - 5
	121 - 5
	130 - 6
	131 - 6

V) "RESHAPE WIDE"

	Copy-paste second observations (recitation) of each ID side-by-side with first observations (lecture)
	(keep ALL columns, especially sequence number and lecture flag)

VI) SORT & COLOR BY RECITATION SECTION NUMBER (COLUMN R)

VII) RANDOMLY ASSIGN RECITATION, THEN LECTURE

	A) PASTE VECTOR OF RANDOM NUMBERS IN COLUMN U
	B) SORT **WITHIN SECTION NUMBER** ACCORDING TO RANDOM VARIATE
	C) ASSIGN RECITATIONS IN SEQUENCE (COLUMN W) ACCORDING TO PROPORTIONS:
	     201: 12, 203: 14, 205: 14, 207: 14, 231: 22
	     202: 16, 204: 17, 206: 19, 208: 17, 232: 29
	     211: 18, 213: 17, 215: 18, 217: 18, 241: 30
	     212: 16, 214: 13, 216: 19, 218: 14, 242: 29
	     221:  7, 223:  8, 225:  8, 227:  8, 251: 13
	     222:  8, 224: 19, 226: 15, 228: 19, 252: 27

	D) ASSIGN LECTURE **TO A COLUMN CLOSE TO LEFT HAND SIDE**

VIII) RESHAPE LONG AGAIN

	Re-paste recitation copy to below lecture copy
	**TAKE CARE TO MAKE SURE COLUMNS LINE UP**

IX) DELETE GHOST LECTURES FOR UNPAIRED OBSERVATIONS

	Sort by column with ghost flag, delete all with X

X) RESORT BY MASTER ORDER
